## Benefits and scope of participating

### Why participate in GSDN? What are the benefits? 

* Participate in a collaborative network with other trusted service organizations.
* Extend the impact and reach of your services. By sharing resources, coordinating workflows, and forging new inter-institutional partnerships, we believe we can augment our organization's individual capacities.
* Support your organization's strategic goals.
* Facilitate access to collections held by California institutions on a national scale.
* Enrich and strengthen communities in the region and across the state.


### What kinds of organizations can participate in the GSDN?
Affiliate membership is open to non-profit organizations that are currently providing free or low-cost services to libraries, archives, museums, and related cultural heritage organizations in California.


### What services must my organization offer?
Your organization determines what service it would like to offer, and the particular terms of service (e.g., eligibility, if free or cost-recovery).  Some Affiliates offer the full range of services from consulting on digital project management, collection assessment, digitization of a variety of format of materials, metadata creation and remediation, hosting of digital collections, and digital preservation.  Others offer specific services, such as digitization training and a self-service scanning lab.
