The GSDN supports peer-to-peer collaboration between organizations that are currently providing free or low-cost services to California libraries, archives, museums and other cultural heritage institutions, to support the lifecycle management and broad public access to unique digital collections -- leveraging existing statewide and national discovery systems.

Through participation in the GSDN, service organizations can more effectively share resources, coordinate workflows, and forge new inter-institutional partnerships -- thereby augmenting each organization's individual capacities.

The GSDN currently comprises the following Affiliates:

* Balboa Park Online Collaborative (BPOC)
* California Digital Library (CDL)
* California State University Dominguez Hills Library
* California State University Northridge Library
* Los Angeles Public Library
* San Francisco Public Library
* University of California Merced Library
* University of Southern California Libraries

The CDL serves as a convener of the GSDN. Through its role as a Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) Service Hub, the CDL also serves as conduit for aggregating digital collections from GSDN Affiliates (as well as individual institutions) at the statewide level through its Calisphere platform -- and at the national level through the DPLA platform.
