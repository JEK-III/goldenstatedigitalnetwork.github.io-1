Individual GSDN Affiliates establish long-term partnerships with cultural heritage institutions to help with one or more aspects of making their collections digitally available. GSDN Affiliates set their own services, costs (free or at-cost), and geographic eligibility criteria.

## More digital collections help


### Help making digital collections discoverable

The CDL offers free metadata harvesting and aggregation services that confer statewide and national visibility through Calisphere and DPLA.

### Help with everything!

If your organization needs help with everything, we'd encourage you to also explore the **California Revealed** program. California Revealed is a State Library initiative to help Californiaâ€™s public libraries, in partnership with other local heritage groups, digitize, preserve, and provide online access to archival materials - books, newspapers, photographs, audiovisual recordings, and more - that tell the incredible stories of the Golden State. The program also provides free access and preservation services for existing digital collections, including technical advice and guidance, for partner organizations with in-house digitization programs
