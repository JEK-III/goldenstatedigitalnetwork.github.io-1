## Services Available Through California Revealed

If your organization needs help with everything, we'd encourage you to also explore the **California Revealed** program. California Revealed is a State Library initiative to help Californiaâ€™s public libraries, in partnership with other local heritage groups, digitize, preserve, and provide online access to archival materials - books, newspapers, photographs, audiovisual recordings, and more - that tell the incredible stories of the Golden State. The program also provides free access and preservation services for existing digital collections, including technical advice and guidance, for partner organizations with in-house digitization programs
